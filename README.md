# leetcode
Here is a repo of some of my leetcode solutions, all code has been accepeted by leetcode and passed all test cases. To 
use in leetcode you may need to change some method names. I use this for reference and to showcase my interest in learning.
Feel free to use any of this code if you would also like to.
